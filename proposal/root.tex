\begin{abstract}
  In this project we aim to use to technique of feedback linearization to generate a stable periodic walking motion for a highly nonlinear system with hybrid dynamics, namely a 5 link bipedal robot modeled in a plane. The robot has a total of 5 controlled joints and a total of 7 degrees of freedom.
